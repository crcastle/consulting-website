            <p class="bio">
              With over a decade of professional and personal software
              engineering experience, including stints in Product Management and
              Developer Relations, I excel at solving tough problems,
              simplifying complexity, and adapting to new technologies.

                  <h3>API and Data Integration</h3>
                  <p>
                    Integrate with external APIs like Twilio or Salesforce, or
                    connect existing internal services.

                  <h3>Backend Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    Short-term staff augmentation. I have experience with many
                    languages and tools: Node.js, Ruby, Go, Python, SQL, Bash,
                    Postgres, Kafka, AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, Heroku, and more.

                <div>
                  <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                  <p>
                    Prove out a new idea quickly, clarifying the cost and time
                    required to get it live. From Arduino to data pipelines to
                    distributed systems, I probably have the experience to help
                    you, and if I don't I'll get up to speed quickly.

                  <h3>Project Recovery</h3>
                  <p>
                    Rescue a project that has gone over budget and over
                    schedule. I'll assess the current state, recommended a path
                    forward, and write or refactor the code to get you back on
                    track.

                  <h3>Debugging</h3>
                  <p>
                    Determine the source of especially tricky bugs and resolve
                    them. Not all engineers enjoy and excel at debugging. It's
                    one of my favorite tasks, and I'm very good at it.<br /><br />

                  <h3>CI/CD Automation</h3>
                  <p>
                    Increase developer productivity by iterating faster on new
                    features, bug fixes, and refactoring. I'll automate your
                    deploy process using your existing tools (e.g. GitHub, AWS,
                    Heroku, Netlify) or suggest new ones.

                      build the product? How is this going to affect the team?
                      How do we prioritize? How do we mange our people? How do
                      we manage our bosses? It’s very rare to find someone who
                      can speak intelligently and in depth on all these topics
                      without bullshitting.

                      probably should. He actually gives a damn about customers

                      Chris demonstrated an affinity with tackling big,
                      undefined ideas. His unique ability to learn new concepts
                      and leverage his technical expertise proved successful.
                      Above all though, Chris’s ability to connect and build
                      positive relationships with other people will be a huge
                      part of his legacy.

                      Chris is talented, insightful, and user focused. He
                      possesses enthusiasm and the ability to come up with novel
                      approaches to problems. Having him on a team fundamentally
                      changes the way that team works and delivers, and does so
                      for the better.
